# Robot-Localization-using-Deep-Learning-and-Particle-Filter

1) Goal of the study was to choose the best approach for robot localization between Deep Learning and Particle Filter

2) Used ROS implementation of the robot simulator to generate smooth trajectories of robot for both synthetically generated and captured in the real-world grid maps

3) Used python libraries Theano to efficiently evaluate and optimize mathematical expressions and Keras for enabling fast experimentation of convolutional and recurrent network

4) Used Navigation Stack to take odometry, sensor streams and a goal as an input and to give safe velocity as an output

5) Deep Learning approach performed better for larger maps while Particle Filter performed well in small maps
